    "Population growth problems often give rise to rate equations that are first-order. For example, the equation\n",

    "$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = a N - b N^2\\;,$$\n",

    "might describe how the number of individuals in a population, $N$, varies with time. Here the first term $aN$ corresponds to the birth of new members, while the second term $-bN^2$ corresponds to deaths.  The death term is proportional to $N^2$ to allow for the fact that food will become harder to find when the population $N$ becomes large.  Begin by solving this  equation with $b=0$ using the Euler method, and compare your numerical result with the exact solution. Then solve the  equation with nonzero values $b$. Give an intuitive explanation of your results.  Interesting values of $a$ and $b$ depend on the initial population $N$. For small $N(0)$, $a = 10$ and $b=3$ is a good choice, while for $N(0) = 1000$ a good choice is $a = 10$ and $b=0.01$.\n",

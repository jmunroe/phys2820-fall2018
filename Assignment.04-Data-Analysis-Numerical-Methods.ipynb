To do this they shoot a projectile up into the air and measure its velocity with a radar gun.  Their results are in a file called `martian_vel.dat`."

They use Newton's 2nd Law to write $m a = -m g - b v$, i.e. \"m a\" plotted as a function of velocity should be a straight line the slope and intercept of which are determined by $m$, $g$ and the drag coefficient $b$.  Plot the force (\"m a\") as a function of velocity.  The mass of the projectile is 0.5 kg."

To do this, first solve the force equation analytically, leaving $g$ and $b$ as unknown coefficients.  The students are pretty sure the initial velocity should be 20 m/s."

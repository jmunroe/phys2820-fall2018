While such a comparison will not be possible for most of the numerical calculations you will encounter, exact results are sometime available in certain limits, that is, for special values of the paramters. You should always run your program in those limits to check that it gives the correct answer. This is a necessary (but not sufficient) test that a program is correct in the general case."
